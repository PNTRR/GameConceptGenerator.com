        <div class="content">
            <p>The gaming industry has evolved for over 80 years since the creation of Nimatron in 1940. While games have transformed dramatically from their early forms, one challenge remains constant: creative crisis.</p>

            <div class="methodology-item main-problem">
                <h3>🎯 The CCDI Challenge</h3>
                <p><strong>Creative Crisis in Developed Industry</strong> - where developers face paralysis not from lack of ideas, but from too many possibilities in an evolved industry. This affects everyone—from beginners overwhelmed by options to veterans struggling against decades of precedent.</p>
            </div>

            <p>With thousands of games released annually and 80+ years of accumulated design knowledge, the pressure to create "something completely new" becomes creatively paralyzing rather than inspiring. The paradox of choice in today's saturated market makes genuine innovation increasingly challenging.</p>

            <p>Unlike conventional idea generators that provide complete concepts, our tool takes a different approach. We offer fundamental building blocks that force creative engagement while leaving ample room for your unique perspective and expertise.</p>

            <div class="methodology-item highlight-item">
                <h3>💡 Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>True creativity in today's landscape isn't about finding completely original ideas—it's about creating <strong>novel combinations</strong> of existing elements and executing them with personal vision and technical excellence. The generator gives you questions, not answers, sparking the "how" and "why" behind creative decisions.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Each combination should be treated as a creative prompt rather than a final concept. The real work begins when you explore the possibilities, ask what unique perspective you can bring to these fundamental elements, and make them truly your own through your specific skills and creative vision.</p>

            <p>This approach prevents option paralysis while encouraging genuine creative problem-solving. It respects your expertise as a developer while providing the spark needed to overcome creative blocks in today's complex development landscape.</p>
